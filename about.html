                <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
                <p>Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA) is the #1 voluntary health organization in the United States for people living with muscular dystrophy, ALS, and related neuromuscular diseases.</p>
                <p>For 75 years, MDA has led the way in accelerating research, advancing care, and advocating for the support of our families. MDA's mission is to empower the people we serve to live longer, more independent lives.</p>
                <h2>Our Impact</h2>
                <p>Being diagnosed with a neuromuscular disease can bring fear, frustration, and far too many unknowns. MDA brings something else: access to expert care, science that moves theory to therapy, and programs built to support life beyond the diagnosis.</p>
                <h2>Changing What Comes Next</h3>
                <p>A diagnosis used to mean more questions than answers. Today, because of MDA-funded research, more than 25 treatments for neuromuscular disease have been approved by the FDA in just the last decade â€” and more are on the horizon. Families now hear about options, not just obstacles.</p>
                <p>What it means: Life expectancy, treatment options, and day-to-day care have all improved. Kids who once had no available therapies are now accessing gene therapy in early childhood. Adults are participating in clinical trials that didn't exist five years ago.</p>
                <h2>Powered by a Connected Community</h3>
                <p>Our impact isn't just measured in milestones; it's powered by people. Families, clinicians, researchers, advocates, and allies build momentum every day: driving clinical trials, shaping regulatory decisions, mobilizing on Capitol Hill, and creating lasting change in their own communities. There's power in our numbers, and it shows. This progress is possible because of a dedicated corps of supporters, from grassroots volunteers to partners like CITGO, the International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF), and the National Association of Letter Carriers (NALC). Together, we're not only imagining a better future - we're making it move faster.</p>
