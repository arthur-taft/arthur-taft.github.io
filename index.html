                        <p>Since 1950, MDA has led the field in research, care, and advocacy for people living with neuromuscular diseases. We've delivered real progress: research that supports more accurate diagnoses, stronger care models, and therapies that were unthinkable a generation ago. We continue to work together to elevate the voices of our community, driving regulatory and legislative policies that recognize the agency and dignity of people living with neuromuscular disease. Lastly, we have we created a community where people of all ages and any diagnosis can find connection, education, and resources.</p>
                        <p>As a neuroscientist and as MDA's interim President and CEO, I see the path ahead clearly: full of urgency, grounded in evidence, and driven by people like you. Thank you for being here.</p>
                        <p>Let's keep going - together.</p>
