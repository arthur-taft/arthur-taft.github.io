                <button class="accordion-question">Question: What causes Muscular Dystrophy?</button>
                <div class="accordion-answer">
                    <p>Answer: Muscular dystrophy (MD) is primarily caused by genetic mutations that affect the proteins responsible for healthy muscle structure and function. The altered genes disrupt the production of proteins like dystrophin, leading to progressive muscle weakness and degeneration.</p>
